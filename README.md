## Education

- **Ph.D. in Statistics, Missouri S&T (_Expected Spring 2026_)**
  - **Research Expertise:** 
    - **Survaival Analysis:** Reccurent Events, Cox PH Model, Accelerated Life Models, Effective Age Processes
      - **Paper:** Accelerated Gap Times Model With Fixed Covariates Under A Family Of Effective Age Processes
      - **Overview:** Developed a family of models to quantify intervention effect on system longevity, shifting time scales, like accelerated life models, with applications in engineering, real estate, actuarial science, and medicine to predict depreciation, retirement, and intervention outcomes.

        ![A-pictorial-representation-of-recurrent-event-data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c3e2d8f-998b-49f8-b049-48d6ae4025a4)

      - **Summary:**  
      My research in Survival Analysis aims to enhance the accelerated gap times (AGT) model by incorporating effective age processes, providing a comprehensive framework to model systems undergoing interventions.

        - **Effective Age Models Explored:**  
          - **Always Minimal Intervention Model:** Assumes minimal impact from interventions on system age.  
          - **Always Perfect Intervention Model:** Considers interventions that fully reset the system's effective age.  
          - **Kijima's Model II:** Extends the previous models to include imperfect interventions, offering a more realistic representation of practical scenarios.

        - **Estimaton Methods:**  
          - **Efficient Semiparametric Estimators:** This approach combines the flexibility of nonparametric methods with the efficiency of parametric models, improving estimation accuracy without overly restrictive assumptions.
          - **Rank-Based One-Step Estimator:** Enhances efficiency and robustness by accurately estimating regression parameters and overcoming convexity issues associated with the log-rank weight in the estimating function.
          - **Aalen-Type Estimator:** Integrates moment-based and nonparametric maximum likelihood methods to enhance the precision and flexibility of baseline intensity function estimation.

        - **Analysis of Estimator Properties:**  
          - Examination of asymptotic properties to ensure estimator consistency and efficiency.  
          - Evaluation of finite sample properties through empirical methods and simulations conducted in MATLAB to validate theoretical findings.

        - **Performance Evaluation:**  
          - The model's performance was tested using the bladder tumor data from Byar (1980), assessing practical utility and robustness in real-world intervention scenarios.  
          - Demonstrated the predictive accuracy and applicability of the enhanced AGT model on this dataset.

    - **Deep Learning-Based Survival Analysis:** Cox-based DNN, DeepHit, RNN-SURV, DeepWeiSurv, DeepPAMM
    - **Current Work**: This research is about integrating deep learning with traditional methods, using advanced models such as Cox-based Deep Neural Networks (DNN), DeepHit, RNN-SURV, DeepWeiSurv, and DeepPAMM to improve the predictive power. We also intend to address complex challenges related to various outcome types—including censoring, truncation, competing risks, and recurrent events—as well as data complexities like time-varying, high-dimensional features, and multimodality. This approach should result in more precise and robust predictions for machinery maintenance and reliability.
